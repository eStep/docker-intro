Here are things that attendants of the workshop need to prepare in advance.

- bring your laptop with you
- make sure you'll have internet connection
  - Eduroam is available if you have an account for that
  - alternatively, a cable connection is available -- if you need that make sure you bring an ethernet adapter
- ssh client
  - mac and linux users dont need to prepare anything
  - windows users need to download and install [git for windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
- an ssh key pair; you can use a key pair that you already have, or generate a new one with a command
`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
- if on Linux or Mac: install Docker; choose your OS and follow the corresponding instructions for [Linux](http://docs.docker.com/linux/started/) or [Mac](http://docs.docker.com/mac/started/)
- for Windows users and those who don't want ot install Docker on their machines, there will be cloud VM available; in that case only ssh conncection and your ssh key pair is needed
