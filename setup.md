For the entire workshop, independent of the operating system, we will be using
`docker-machine`. You will learn more about `docker-machine` during the workshop.

Following are the instructions to setup `docker-machine` on your computer.

## Windows
On Windows, the simplest way to setup `Docker`, `docker-machine` and `docker-compose` is
is to use [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox).

* Download an installer from
[Docker Toolbox page](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox)

* Follow
[installation instructions for windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/step_one/)

## Mac OS X
On Mac, the sipmlest way to setup `Docker`, `docker-machine` and `docker-compose`
is to use [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox).

* Download an installer from
[Docker Toolbox page](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox)

* Follow
[installation instructions for windows](https://docs.docker.com/mac/step_one/)

## Linux
Make sure you have 64 bit linux version. You cannot run `docker-engine` on
32 bit linux.
Even though docker can be installed in most linux distributions with a package
manager, we recommend using VirtualBox and `docker-machine`.

* VirtualBox

    Download and install VirtualBox from
    [Oracle website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)
    
* `docker-engine`

    Install by following instructions on
    [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
    
* `docker-machine`
   
    Install by following instructions on
    [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/).
